class OpenFoamParser(OutputParser):
    """A class for parsing output from OpenFOAM CFD simulations.

    This class inherits from the OutputParser base class and implements
    functionality to parse output files from OpenFOAM simulations into a format
    that can be used by FlowForge.

    OpenFOAM is a popular open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox
    that can be used for simulating complex fluid flows, heat transfer, and more.

    Attributes
    ----------

    Notes
    -----
    This parser is currently marked as "To Be Implemented" and will be
    developed in a future update.

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the OpenFoamParser.

        This method will set up any necessary configuration for parsing OpenFOAM output files,
        including paths to solution directories and configuration for specific versions of OpenFOAM.

        -----
        Currently not implemented.

        Parse OpenFOAM output files into FlowForge data structures.

        This method will read OpenFOAM output files (typically found in the case/time directories),
        extract relevant data like velocity, pressure, temperature fields, and convert them into a
        format that can be used by FlowForge.

        Currently not implemented. When implemented, this method will return
        a list of data structures containing the parsed output from OpenFOAM simulations.
